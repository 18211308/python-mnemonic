Mnemonic code for deterministic keys
====================================

A scheme for translating binary data (usually master seeds for deterministic
keys, but it can be applied to any binary data) into a group of easy to remember
words also known as mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence.

Such mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence is much easier to work with than working
with the binary data directly (or its hexadecimal interpretation). The sentence
could be writen down on paper (e.g. for storing in a secure location such as
safe), told over telephone or other voice communication method, or memorized in
ones memory (also called as brainwallet).

See BIP_0039.txt for full specification.
